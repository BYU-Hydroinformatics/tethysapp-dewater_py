# tethysapp-dewater_py

This is a web application that functions in the browser. The platform is based off of the tethysplatform which can be found at
< www.tethysplatform.org >. The web application is intended to serve as a learning tool to help people understand how groundwater works and especially local dewatering for construction projects. The majority of the model functions with python and the styling as well as error-checking take place in javascript.

This was developed at Brigham Young University under the direction of Dr. Norm Jones, PE. in the Civil Engineering Department
